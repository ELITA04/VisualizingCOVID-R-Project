# ðŸ¦  Visualizing COVID-19 Using R

**Note:** This project was built with an aim to learn R language and how to visualize and plot graphs in R.

### ðŸ“ˆ Some insights in the data

1. In section 3, when we plot the graph of total number of cases in China vs the World, we notice that till March 14, 2019 the number of cases in China was greater than the World.
2. After March 15, 2019 there was a steep rise in cases all over the World.
3. On February 13, 2019 China only accepted CT-Scans as evidence for positive cases. Thus, there is a huge jump after the 13th.
4. After February 15, 2019 the growth in the number of cases in China could be described as a linear growth.
5. Finally, on plotting the hardest hit countires we notice that Italy saw a tremendous increase in cases between March 02 and March 16, 2019.
